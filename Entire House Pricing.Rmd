# Ordinary Kriging
```{r Kriging Model}
evgm <- variogram(price ~ 1, home_listings_sp, boundaries = seq(0, 20000, l = 100))
fvgm <- fit.variogram(evgm, fit.ranges = FALSE, fit.sills = FALSE, 
                      vgm(psill = 10000, model = "Exp", range = 6000, nugget = 0))
plot(evgm)
```

Normally, a variogram will show an increase in semivariance as distance increases.  In this particular case, the exact opposite is occurring.  As distance increases, semivariance decreases.  Due to this anomaly, a kriging model could not be developed to fit the data.


# Geographically Weighted Multiple Linear Regression Models

gwr_distance <- gwr.basic(price ~ accommodates + bathrooms + bedrooms,
                          data = home_listings_sp, bw = 500, kernel = 'gaussian')

gwr_distance
```

## Model Two (Variable Distance )
```{r Variable Distance Model}
gwr_variable <- gwr.basic(price ~ accommodates + bathrooms + bedrooms,
                     data = home_listings_sp, adaptive = TRUE, bw = 100)

### Multiple Linear Regression Models
When developing the multiple linear regression models, backwards design was used to select the predictors.  The initial model consisted of all predictors, then predictors were eliminated one at a time based on their statistical significance.  Once the model had only statitistically significant predictors, other predictors were eliminated if their coefficiencts were near zero to simplify the model.  The final model contained three predictors: accommodates, bathrooms, and bedrooms.

#### Global Multiple Linear Regression Model
price = 14.031 + (13.647)accommodates + (37.469)bathrooms + (9.589)bedrooms

With a global mean price of around £140, this model does a relatively good job of price predictions.  The model shows that for each person increase in the number of people the property accommodates there is a £13.65 increase in price.  For each additional bathroom, the price increases by £37.47, and each additional bedroom increases the price by £9.59.  Each of these coefficients make sense in the context of the problem.  However, it must be mentioned here that the Adjusted R-squared value for this model is only 0.1009, so this regression model only explains about 10.1% of the overall variance in price.  This is partially due to the fact that location is not taken into account here.  In addition, ammenities and the luxury of a property can have a large impact on the price, which cannot be explained by this model.

#### Geographically Weighted Multiple Linear Regression Model (Fixed Distance)
price = (-655.1806 to 402.22) + (-201.6781 to 292.78)accommodates + (-451.5464 to 656.09)bathrooms + 
        (-287.4810 to 386.88)bedrooms

Adjusted R-square:  0.1188995 (11.9%)

#### Geographically Weighted Multiple Linear Regression Model (Variable Distance)
price = (-392.9895 to 341.905) + (-70.0892 to 84.844)accommodates + (-205.4354 to 357.073)bathrooms +
        (-142.6069 to 207.170)bedrooms

Adjusted R-square:  0.1254795 (12.5%)

#### Model Comparisons
Although the geographically weighted multiple linear regression models are harder to interpret because of their range of coefficient values, they do perform slightly better than the global linear regression model.  In the first geographically weighted multiple linear regression model (fixed distance), a bandwidth of 500 meters was used.  Edinburgh, Scotland is 264 square kilometers, so a bandwidth needed to be used that was small enough to capture the nuance of each neighborhoods.  Additionally, a bandwidth that was too large would too closely resemble the global multiple linear regresion model. The fixed distance model also improved the Adjusted R-squared value from 10.1% to 11.9%.

The second geographically weighted multiple linear regression model (variable distance) improved the Adjusted R-squared even a bit more to 12.5%.  In this model, the distance bandwidth is variable depending on the number of observations surrounding a given home.  A bandwidth of 100 was used, meaning the price was predicted using the 100 closest observations.  This model helps with the geographic variability of the listings.  A majority of the listings are concentrated at the city center and are far more dispersed as you move out from the city center.  By using a variable distance model, this affect can be taken into account and guarantees each prediction is using the same number of neighbors for estimation.

When it comes to choosing a preferred model, there are a number of different considerations to be taken into account, such as the distinctness of neighborhoods within a given area, the overall size of a given area, and the purpose of the model.  If interpretability is the most important factor, the global multiple linear regression model would be the best choice; and if the observed area was relatively small, this would be a perfectly good model.  If the neighborhoods are distinct, but the data points are dispersed evenly throughout the observed area, then a geographically weighted linear regression model would be a better choice.  For this particular project, the neighborhood in which each listing is located appears to have an affect on the price.  With the data points being highly concentrated in one area and many fewer data points being dispersed through the remainder of the observed space, a variable distance geographically weighted linear regression model is the best choice moving forward.  However, to improve overall pricing estimations, information should be mined on the text data found in the "summary", "space", "description", "neighborhood_overview", and "transit" fields.  My hypothesis would be that a large portion of the price in a listing would be based on the information about ammenities and luxuries found in these fields.
