# Airbnb Price Prediction Project

Using the tmap package in RStudio, GIS and spatial analysis was used to predict Airbnb pricing for the "Entire home/apt" category in Edinburgh, Scotland.  After cleaning and preprocessing the data, a map of all properties by neighborhood was created.  Different modeling was then used to predict the price of a property.  These modeled included proximity polygons, inverse distance weighting using different alpha values, trend surface analysis using first and second degree polynomials, and weighted multiple linear regression models using both fixed and variable distance.  The chosen model was the variable distance geographically weighted linear regression model.

This project was then conducted again; this time predicting Airbnb pricing for the "Private Room" category in Edinburgh, Scotland.
